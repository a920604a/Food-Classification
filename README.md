# Food Recognition ML Project

## Project Description
This project aims to build a machine learning model to recognize and classify food images into predefined categories. The model can be used for dietary tracking, restaurant automation, and health applications.

## Problem Statement
Food recognition is a challenging task due to the diversity of food appearances, cooking styles, and presentation. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of food into categories such as pizza, sushi, salad, burger, and more. This model can help users automatically log meals, assist restaurants in menu management, and provide insights into dietary habits.

## Dataset
We use theFood-101 dataset, which contains 101,000 images of 101 different food categories. Each category has 1,000 images, split into 750 training images and 250 test images. Images vary in size and presentation style, providing a realistic challenge for classification models.
